# Find Most Frequent Item

#   Implement a function which takes a tuple as a parameter and returns another 
# tuple with two elements. First element is the most frequent item and the second 
# element of number of repetition.

# Hint: Use count() method

# Example

# my_tuple = ("a","b","c","d","e","a","c","e","b","e","c","a","f","e","r")
# most_frequent(my_tuple)
# Output

# ('e', 4)

def most_frequent(v_tuple):
    j

my_tuple = ("a","b","c","d","e","a","c","e","b","e","c","a","f","e","r")
print(most_frequent(my_tuple))
