## Project 7 - Leap Year


# Instructions

Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February. 

Three criteria must be taken into account to identify leap years:

This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year. 

> `The year must be evenly divisible by 4;
> If the year can also be evenly divided by 100, it is not a leap year;
>  **unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400`

e.g. The year 2000:

2000 รท 4 = 500 (Leap)

2000 รท 100 = 20 (Not Leap)

2000 รท 400 = 5 (Leap!)

So the year 2000 is a leap year.


# Example Input

2400
