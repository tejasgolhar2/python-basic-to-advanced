# insert method is superior to append method
# here, we can add an element in the list at the position where we want

list1 = ['a','b','c','d']
list1.insert(2,'element')
print(list1)

# the insert method takes two parameters viz., index and the element
# the original list is inserted with a new element and hence it is printed by its original name
