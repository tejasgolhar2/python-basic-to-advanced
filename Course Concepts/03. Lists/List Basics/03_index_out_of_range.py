# consider the below list
numbers = [11, 12, 113, 45]

# print list
print(numbers)

# number of elements in the list
print("Elements present in the list :",len(numbers))

# trying to get element for index one more than the present \
print(numbers[len(numbers)])

# results "index out of range" error. Here, also known as "Off by one error"
# similar is the case when we try to access elements with index values not even present in the list
