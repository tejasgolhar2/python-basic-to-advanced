# creating a dictionary
# every key must have a value associated with it, we can't generate a key without assigning value to it
# all the key-value pairs must have the same indentation level in the dictionary definition

dictionary1 = {
    "Tejas":"He is a very good boy that lives in Wardha",
    "Neha" : "A beautiful girl sings like a Koyal",
    "Ravi" : "He is calm minded clever boy",
}

# create an empty dictionary

# Approach 1
dictionary2 = dict()

# Approach 2
dictionary3 = {}
