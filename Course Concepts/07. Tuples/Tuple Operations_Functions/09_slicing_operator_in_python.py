# Use of SLICING OPERATOR IN PYTHON

# To access the element of the tuple as per our requirement
# Works the complete same way as we have used it in Lists


# Tuple Operations


numbers = (11, 12, 113, 45)

print(numbers[:])

print(numbers[1:])
# skips the element with index = 0 and prints the rest

print(numbers[:2])
# prints elements till index < 2

print(numbers[1:3])
# prints elements from element of index = 1 to index < 3

print(numbers[2:3])
# prints the element with index 2 only

# the slicing operation works like the range functon, i.e., one elements less than the upper limit specified
