# Guessing the Number

## Instruction


Create a program will generate a random number unknown to the user between upper and lower bond that user provided. The user needs to guess what that number is. If the userâ€™s guess is wrong, the program should return some sort of indication as to how wrong (e.g. The number is too high or too low). If the user guesses correctly, a positive indication should appear. 


> `Your program should ask for upper and lower bound from the user initially.` 

>   `Calculate chances of user based on upper and lower bounds.` 

>    `Based on calculated number of chances ask input from user for guessing the number.` 

> `If the guessed number is greater than the generated number then print - "You guessed too high", otherwise print - "You guessed too low". And finally if the numbers match print - "Congratulations you did it in"`

Output can be like this:

```
Enter Lower bound: 1
Enter Upper bound: 7

    You've only  3  chances to guess the integer!

Guess a number: 4
You Guessed too high!
Guess a number: 1
You guessed too small!
Guess a number: 2
Congratulations you did it in  3  try

The number is 2
    Better Luck Next time!

```

# Hint

- Log function from math module to calculate chances. (math.log(upper - lower + 1, 2))
